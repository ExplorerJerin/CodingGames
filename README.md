Hello friends,

This repository mainly focuses on solving CodinGame challenges using C. While C can be a bit challenging, especially on platforms like CodinGame, it offers a great opportunity to deeply understand pointers and other core programming concepts. Iâ€™m trying to write raw, minimal code with as few helper functions as possible to keep things transparent and educational. I believe this approach will benefit not only new coders but also all beginners learning C. I'm also following the Norminette coding standards to make the code more elegant, readable, and easier to understand.
Wishing you all the best on your coding journey!
